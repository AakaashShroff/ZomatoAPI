# ZomatoAPI
This project had aimed to order food with a voice command connected with my personal AI, but there's a problem.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This script started off to be integrated with my personal AI assistant JARVIS which is currently being upgraded.

JARVIS once completed will be a separate repository.

This script was to ensure that I can order food using a voice command, eg: if I said I wanted a pizza, it would go through a dictionary and find a restaurant that had pizza as an option and automate ordering it.

Here's the problem: half way developing this I realised that zomato does not support website food ordering so the script now just ends at clicking order now and opening the respective restaurant page.

Running it the first time asks maunal login and stores the cookies for next time so no manual login needed further till cookies expire.

Luckily, swiggy has the option to order food from website so I am going to proceed with a swiggy script that orders food for me based on my favourite food from a particular restaurant based on a voice command that JARVIS would process and use to place an order.
